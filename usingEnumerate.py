""" You're really getting the hang of using iterators, great job!

You've just gained several new ideas on iterators from the last video and one of them is the enumerate() function. Recall that enumerate() returns an enumerate object that produces a sequence of tuples, and each of the tuples is an index-value pair.

In this exercise, you are given a list of strings mutants and you will practice using enumerate() on it by printing out a list of tuples and unpacking the tuples using a for loop. """

# Create a list of strings: mutants
mutants = ['charles xavier', 
            'bobby drake', 
            'kurt wagner', 
            'max eisenhardt', 
            'kitty pryde']

# Create a list of tuples: mutant_list
mutant_list = list(enumerate(mutants))

# Print the list of tuples
print(mutant_list)

# Unpack and print the tuple pairs
for index1, value1 in mutant_list:
    print(index1, value1)

# Change the start index
for index2,value2 in enumerate(mutant_list,start=1):
    print(index2, value2)
